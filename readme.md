# 100 Days of Devops with Kev

I'm going to blog this as a i go, i'll be following the path of a previous blogger @lakhera2015 who did this in 2019. I may divert and take my own direction too. 

## The driver

I'm currently a specialist developer, i'm a tech lead whose only done frontend work and been witness to but never dived into the world of devops that much. My skill level isn't zero of course, i've built from scratch many CI/CD pipelines but only of frontend projects on the whole.

## The goal 

I want to move into a solutions architect direction with my career, on the way to that is the need to bolster up two key areas:

- Devops - the next 100 days.
- Backend - i've done some backend work in nodejs and before that PHP but nothing recently and the knowledge is vauge to say the least. The next time im posed a simple database question, i want that information there and then to jump forth from my mind - not an hour later when the opportunity has passed. This is just practice essentially but i'd also like to learn a few new stacks too and get a broader experience. 

## Every day is a school day

I've been in software development professionally 16 years now, i've worn a lot of hats. There is more out there than is possible for one person to learn properly many factors over - at least i've never met someone who'd even claim it. The important thing from my POV is the foster a growth mindset, and embrace the unknown as a chance to grow and find out something intereestint. If you sign yourself off and box yourself in - then your future is a small dark corner of a vast world of interesting stuff.
